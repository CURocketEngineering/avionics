## Compiling

- On 32bit Linux target, simply: `make`
- On 64bit Linux target:
    - Intall 32bit compatible libraries: `sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6`
    - `make`
- On MacOS:
    - Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
    - `make builddocker`
    - `make dall`

## Firmware

- Output file: `obj/trigger.abs.bin`
- Upload the file via local XMODEM or use Over-the-air upgrade if the current firmware supports it (you can use [pxbee-fwup.js](https://github.com/exsilium/pxbee-fwup.js))
- See further [Programmable XBee documentation](http://xbee-sdk-doc.readthedocs.io)

## Trigger

Send a Unicast ZCL "On" command to trigger the connected relay for 125ms. The state of the switch remains in "Off" state. Broadcast command is ignored by default.

```
Endpoint: 0xEA,
clusterId: 0x0006,
profileId: 0x0104,
command: 0x01
```

## Settings

The following defines can be altered in `custom.h` prior to compilation to change the behavior how the Trigger works:

|  Name | Description | Default |
| ------| ----------- | ------- |
| `PXBEE_TRIGGER_IGNORE_BROADCAST` | When enabled, ignores broadcast commands and reacts only when unicast messages are sent to the specific address (ignores All On/All Off commands). | Enabled |
| `ZCL_MANUFACTURER` | The reported manufacturer string. For SmartThings local execution support without custom device handler, set this to "Leviton". | "PXBee" |
| `ZCL_MODEL` | The reported model string. For SmartThings local execution support without custom device handler, set this to "ZSS-10". | "Trigger" |
